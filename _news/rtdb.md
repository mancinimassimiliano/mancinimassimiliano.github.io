I started my new position as a tenure-track assistant professor (RTDb) here at the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science (<a href="https://www.disi.unitn.it/">DISI</a>) of the University of Trento. Thanks to all who supported me during this journey! I am excited about the next steps and, if you are interested in joining this new journey, just drop me an email!
