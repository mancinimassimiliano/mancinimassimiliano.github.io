Hello! I am Massimiliano (Massi) an Assistant Professor (RTD-a) at the <a href="http://mhug.disi.unitn.it/">Multimedia and Human Understanding Group</a> at the University of Trento.  The goal of my work is developing algorithms for increasing the generalization capabilities of deep architectures to new visual domains and semantic concepts, focusing on problems such as domain generalization, incremental learning, and compositionality in computer vision. I am a member of <a href="https://ellis.eu/">ELLIS</a>.
